## [1.1.2](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2) (2019-03-26)

### Bug fixes

* The `<CKEditor>` component will not be updated by the `React` itself. The editor won't freeze if the `#data` property was specified as a static string. Closes [#75](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/issues/75). Closes [#78](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/issues/78). ([bdb2ce3](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/commit/bdb2ce3))


## [1.1.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (2019-02-28)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed integration with collaboration features by changing the way how the initial data are passed to an editor instance. Previously the `<ckeditor>` component had been using the `editor.setData()` method which produces invalid results in collaboration. Now the initial data are injected directly into the container on which the editor will be created. Closes [#68](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/issues/68). ([1c93b3e](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/commit/1c93b3e))

* Introduced the `disabled` property which allows switching the editor to the read-only mode. Closes [#53](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/issues/53). ([6765006](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react/commit/6765006))
